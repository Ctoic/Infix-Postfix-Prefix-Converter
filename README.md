# Infix to Postfix and Prefix Converter

This project provides a simple implementation of a stack-based algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) and prefix (Polish Notation) expressions. It also includes functionality to evaluate postfix expressions.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**
- **Infix to Prefix Conversion**
- **Postfix Expression Evaluation**
- **Parentheses Matching and Expression Validation**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

### Building

To build the project, you can use a simple makefile or compile directly using a C++ compiler. Here is a command to compile using g++:
