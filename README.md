# Infix-Postfix-Prefix-Converter
The "infix-to-postfix-prefix-converter" repository on GitHub contains a C++ project that converts infix expressions to postfix or prefix notation and evaluates them using stacks. The project includes a main.cpp file that prompts the user for an infix expression and outputs the converted expression and its evaluated result.
